							<p>The concept of freedom of contract is often employed in commercial arrangements to allow parties
								to address unforeseen or ambiguous situations that may arise during the term of their contract.
								However, this broad freedom is not without limitations, and those exercising decision-making
								powers in a contractual context should be aware that there may be implied restrictions on what
								they can decide and the bases on which they can reach those decisions.</p>
							<p>One recent case that explored the distinction between decision-making involving an exercise of
								absolute contractual rights and the exercise of a contractual discretion was Mid Essex Hospital
								Services NHS Trust v Compass Group UK and Ireland Ltd (t/a Medirest) [2013]. The case concerned
								the correct application of 'service failure points' under a catering supply agreement. The court
								held that there was only one answer to the calculation, and therefore, there was no need for an
								implied term to act rationally. However, in cases where an assessment or choosing from a range
								of options is involved, the decision-maker is required to act rationally, and an implied term to
								that effect will apply.</p>
							<p>The legal standards to which parties will be held when making a decision under a contract and
								the circumstances in which these standards will apply can be complex. For example, an absolute
								contractual right, such as the right to terminate a contract, grants the decision-maker complete
								freedom to act. However, in a case where a contractual discretion is required, the
								decision-maker must exercise their discretion honestly and in good faith, with regard to the
								contract. They must not act arbitrarily, capriciously, irrationally or perversely, and the more
								unlikely the outcome of a decision, the stronger the evidence required to justify it.</p>
							<p>It is important to note that an implied term to act rationally is extremely difficult to
								exclude, even by express terms, and may apply despite references to 'sole and absolute
								discretion' in a contract. The test for rationality derives from public law and the judicial
								review of a public authority's decision. Although some controversy exists regarding the extent
								to which this test should be deployed in a private law dispute, the modern approach derives from
								the Braganza case. The decision-maker should disregard matters which they ought not to take into
								account, and conversely, must not refuse or fail to take into account matters which they ought
								to take into account. The decision-maker must go through a proper process and evidence that
								process.</p>
							<p>In conclusion, parties exercising decision-making powers under a contract should carefully
								consider the legal standards to which they will be held and the circumstances in which these
								standards will apply. They must take care to document their reasoning and follow a proper
								process. By doing so, they can avoid the uncommon pitfalls that can arise from the broad concept
								of freedom of contract.</p>
							<p><b>Avoiding Contractual Pitfalls: The Importance of Contractual Decision-Making Powers</b></p>
							<p>The concept of freedom of contract is commonly used in business agreements. However, it can lead
								to unexpected issues if not handled properly. Not all aspects of a contract can be defined in
								advance, so many companies include contractual decision-making powers to address this issue. But
								when it comes to making decisions, the decision-maker needs to be aware that there may be
								implied restrictions on what they can decide and the basis on which they can make their
								decision.</p>
							<p>Previously, the key distinction was between decision-making involving an exercise of absolute
								contractual rights and the exercise of a contractual discretion. Absolute contractual rights
								allow the decision-maker to act as they choose, while the exercise of contractual discretion is
								subject to an implied term requiring the decision-maker to act rationally. The Court of Appeal
								explored this distinction in the case of Mid Essex Hospital Services NHS Trust v Compass Group
								UK and Ireland Ltd (t/a Medirest) [2013]. The court found that the implied term to act
								rationally operates as a necessary control mechanism in cases where there is no single answer or
								where there is a range of options to choose from.</p>
							<p>In this blog post, we will discuss the legal standards that parties must adhere to when making a
								decision under a contract, and in what circumstances. We will also explore the importance of
								documenting the decision-making process and the outcome. We will then look at two alternative
								standards that have been introduced: the implied standard not to act vexatiously and the higher
								standard of objective reasonableness.</p>
							<p><b>Absolute contractual rights: complete freedom to act</b></p>
							<p>An example of an absolute contractual right is the right to terminate a contract. In TSG
								Building Services plc v South Anglia Housing Ltd [2013], the court noted that either party "for
								no, good or bad reason could terminate at any time." All that matters in such a case is whether
								the party has the right to terminate under the contract or as a matter of law. Other examples of
								absolute contractual rights include cases where the decision-maker has complete freedom to act,
								such as Shurbanova v Forex Capital Markets Ltd [2017], where the court found that there was no
								implied term to act rationally in reaching the decision to revoke trades carried out by
								Shurbanova.</p>
							<p><b>Contractual discretion: duty to act rationally</b></p>
							<p>Contractual discretion involves making an assessment or choosing from a range of options, taking
								into account the interests of both parties. Recent cases where the court has found there to be a
								contractual discretion include Braganza v BP Shipping Ltd [2015], Watson v Watchfinder.co.uk Ltd
								[2017], LBI EHF v Raiffeisen Bank International AG [2018], and Lehman Brothers Special Financing
								Inc v National Power Corporation [2018]. Where a contract includes a contractual discretion, the
								decision-maker must act honestly and in good faith, with regard to the contract. The discretion
								must not be exercised arbitrarily, capriciously, irrationally, or perversely.</p>
							<p><b>More evidence required to support unlikely outcome</b></p>
							<p>The more unlikely an outcome, the stronger the evidence required to persuade the decision-maker
								that it has indeed happened. In Braganza, the court had to determine whether a man had committed
								suicide in order to assess his wife's entitlement to death in service benefits. The act of
								committing suicide was viewed as particularly improbable as the man in question was a practising
								Catholic. The court required strong evidence to determine that he had indeed killed himself.</p>
							<p><b>Both process and outcome important</b></p>
							<p>Not only is the process important, but the outcome is as well. The outcome must not be so
								unreasonable that no reasonable person could have arrived at the same outcome. As the Court of
								Appeal noted in Socimer, the decision remains that of the decision-maker and is hence viewed
								from the decision-maker's perspective.</p>
							<p>If you have not explicitly chosen objective reasonableness or can be certain that the
								decision-maker is exercising an absolute right, you may find yourself in a grey area. In such a
								situation, it is important to carefully consider the decision-making process and document the
								basis of any decision, much like a public authority anticipating a legal challenge. You should
								also avoid taking extreme positions without good reason.</p>
							<p>While you should generally be able to act in your own commercial interest, you must be mindful
								of your contractual obligations and ensure that any decisions made are reasonable and fair to
								all parties involved. Ultimately, it is important to strike a balance between
								protecting your interests and ensuring that you are acting in good faith and in accordance with
								the terms of the contract.
